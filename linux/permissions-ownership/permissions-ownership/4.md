umask
touch file1
mkdir dir1
ls -l file1 dir1


1️⃣ Why is file1 not executable?

So the kernel’s default intent is:

Files start from 666 (rw-rw-rw-)
Directories start from 777 (rwxrwxrwx)

Then umask removes permissions.

Your key insight was correct:
Files do not get execute bits by default.
That’s not just convention — it’s a security model.

If every created file were executable, malware would be trivial.

2️⃣ Why dir1 and file1 differ
You explained this correctly and cleanly.

Let me compress it into an engineer sentence:

umask does not add permissions.
It only removes permissions from a type-specific base.

File base → 666
Directory base → 777
So with umask 022:
Object	Base	Mask	Result
File	666	    022	    644
Dir	    777	    022	    755

That mental table is gold.


3️⃣ Conceptual role of umask (this is the real test)

Your answer:

umask role is to set permissions defaultly

Correct — but incomplete.

Here is the full conceptual model:

umask defines the maximum permissions a newly created object is allowed to have.

Not what it gets.


3️⃣ What it is forbidden from getting.

That distinction matters a lot in automation.
Think of umask as:

A global safety filter
Applied silently

Before you ever see the file

That’s why people say:

“Why did my file come out wrong?”

Answer:

It didn’t. Your umask intervened.

# Files are created non-executable by design; execute must be explicitly granted.
