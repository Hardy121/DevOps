# Linux does NOT care about usernames.

It cares about:
• UID (user ID)
• GID (group ID)
Names are just labels.

Example:
• alpha → UID 1001
• appuser → UID 999
• root → UID 0
Permissions are checked against numbers, not names.

# What Docker actually does 

When you mount a host directory into a container:

Docker does not translate permissions.
It exposes the directory as-is.

That means:
• Same owner UID
• Same group GID
• Same permission bits

Now here’s the killer:

The container has its own users
Even if they have the same name, they almost never have the same UID.

So inside the container:
• You think you’re appuser
• Linux sees: “UID mismatch”
• Permissions fail
777 does not save you from ownership mismatches in real cases.

# Why chmod 777 sometimes STILL fails

Because permissions are only one layer.

Common blockers:
1. UID/GID mismatch (most common)
2. SELinux / AppArmor (host-level)
3. Read-only mounts
4. User namespaces
